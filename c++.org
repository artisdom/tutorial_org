The solution (general)

This might shock you, but if you want to read a file into a string, by far the best method… is also arguably the simplest. 
It shouldn’t shock you. It’s just C++ logic that the simplest method should be the best. 
So, here it is:
assuming in is a file stream opened in input mode):

auto ss = std::ostringstream{};
ss << in.rdbuf();
auto s = ss.str();

You can do it in a single line, if you want:

auto s = static_cast<std::ostringstream&>(
  std::ostringstream{} << in.rdbuf()).str();

(The cast is unfortunately necessary because the insertion operator returns a ostream&, 
not a ostringstream&. static_cast is okay because we obviously know the cast is sound.)
